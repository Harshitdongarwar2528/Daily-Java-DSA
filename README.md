Daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
# Daily Java DSA 🚀

This repository contains my daily practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms using Java**.  
I am starting from the basics and gradually moving towards advanced problems step-by-step for **placement preparation (off-campus & on-campus)**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Stay consistent with daily coding
- Track my DSA learning journey
- Improve logic, optimization, and coding style
