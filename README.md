# Daily Java DSA 🚀

This repository contains my **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms using Java**.  
I am starting from the basics and gradually moving toward advanced problems for **placement preparation (off-campus & on-campus)**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Maintain consistency with daily coding
- Track my DSA learning journey
- Improve logic, optimization, and coding style
